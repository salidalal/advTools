1225728755248828416 2020-02-07 12:31:22 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but...
1225542486875082753 2020-02-07 00:11:13 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> Nevada, I hear you on Yucca Mountain and my Administration will RESPECT you! Congress and previous Administrations have long failed to find lasting solutions – my Administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches – I’m confident we can get it done!
1224685852133031936 2020-02-04 15:27:15 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> It is not the fault of Iowa, it is the Do Nothing Democrats fault. As long as I am President, Iowa will stay where it is. Important tradition!  https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/1224682732208508928 …
1222385653029261312 2020-01-29 07:07:05 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> Why didn’t John Bolton complain about this “nonsense” a long time ago, when he was very publicly terminated. He said, not that it matters, NOTHING!
1217804029599920128 2020-01-16 15:41:21 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> One of the greatest trade deals ever made! Also good for China and our long term relationship. 250 Billion Dollars will be coming back to our Country, and we are now in a great position for a Phase Two start. There has never been anything like this in U.S. history! USMCA NEXT!
1216114135529902081 2020-01-11 23:46:18 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.
1212734798365626369 2020-01-02 15:58:02 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> ....had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!
1209602813019463680 2019-12-25 00:32:38 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> 187 new Federal Judges have been confirmed under the Trump Administration, including two great new United States Supreme Court Justices. We are shattering every record! Read all about this in “The Long Game,” a great new book by @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell. Amazing story!
1207147066075549697 2019-12-18 05:54:22 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> Good marks and reviews on the letter I sent to Pelosi today. She is the worst! No wonder with people like her and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, D.C. has been such a mess for so long - and that includes the previous administration who (and now we know for sure) SPIED on my campaign.
1249691637040795654 2020-04-13 16:31:19 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19.....
1246515478908076034 2020-04-04 22:10:23 Jerusalem Daylight Time <realDonaldTrump> America owes our very hard working food supply workers so much as they produce and deliver high quality food for us during this horrible COVID-19.
